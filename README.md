# perimeter_method

Mrs. Fisher needs your help again! Students are struggling with the concept of perimeter. She has requested that you create a Ruby method for students to easily calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.

Write a method that takes two arguments: the width and the height of a rectangle. It should return the perimeter of the rectangle.
~~~~~
Now, make height an optional argument and assume that if only one argument is specified, the user of the method is assuming the rectangle is a square that has an equal width and height.
